<h1> Welcome to my portfolio website!</h1>
<p> My name is Margaret Dorsey, and I'm a second year dual major Game Design and Development and Computational Math student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
I am also following the Computer Science curriculum above and beyond my minor requirements, and completing a second minor in the Japanese language. Please feel free to look around
and get to know me.
