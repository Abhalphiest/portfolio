Logo was created by me. Any images, video, or other media on the page are solely my own.

Version 1.0 of this site was created for IGME 230, Web Design and Implementation with Professor Sean Boyle, and as such only partially represents my portfolio as to keep with project guidelines.

Versions after 12/2015 are designed explicitly to present my portfolio with no outside constraints.
