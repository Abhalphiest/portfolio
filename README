PORTFOLIO DOCUMENTATION

Created by Margaret Dorsey
Repo Created 10/18/2015	
Last Updated 01/04/2016

All html, css, javascript, php, etc by me with the exception of phpMailer.
This site is now hosted on heroku to support php, but still running through
gh-pages.

Fonts used:
Across The Road by Jonathan S. Harris
Nobility Casual by Digital Graphic Labs
Rounded Elegance by Douglas Charles Cunha

 

Logo was created by me. Any images, video, or other media on the page are solely my own.

Version 1.0 of this site was created for IGME 230, Web Design and Implementation with Professor Sean Boyle, and as such only partially represents my portfolio as to keep with project guidelines.

Versions after 12/2015 are designed explicitly to present my portfolio with no outside constraints.

Currently Refactoring.
