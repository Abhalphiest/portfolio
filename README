Repo Created 10/18/2015	
Last Updated 01/23/2016

All html, css, javascript, php, etc by me with the exception of phpMailer and jQuery.
This site is now hosted on heroku to support php, but still running through
gh-pages.

Fonts used:
WC Mano Negra by WC Fonts
Averua Serif by Dan Sayers
Roboto by Google Android Design

All fonts used are 100% free for use and can be found by name in a web browser of your choice.

The font used in the front page graphic is a mixture of several fonts, but primarily it is
Across the Road by Jonathan S. Harris

Logo was created by me. Any images, video, or other media on the page are solely my own.

Version 1.0 of this site was created for IGME 230, Web Design and Implementation with Professor Sean Boyle, and as such only partially represents my portfolio as to keep with project guidelines.

Versions after 12/2015 are designed explicitly to present my portfolio with no outside constraints.

Currently being refactored to better present my portfolio.
