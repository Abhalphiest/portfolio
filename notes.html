<h1> Notes</h1>
<p> All images were made by me, all CSS, scripts, etc are mine.
Fonts are Across the Road, Caviar Dreams and Rounded Elegance.
<p>
<h2> Above and Beyond </h2>
<p> I went above and beyond by making my own vector graphics for my page styling, and making more than the minimum number of pages. </p>
<h2> Challenges </h2>
<p> I really just ran out of time for polish and plugging in more content on this project. A lot of the CSS was fiddly and took a lot more 
time than I anticipated, and the way that the header works, I never quite figured out how to get the links in the blog sidebar to work the way
I wanted them to. I'll probably revamp the entire blog structure for project 3 when we have some Javascript to play with. </p>
<h2> What I could have done better </h2>
<p> I could have included more than one piece of content for every page - I have more than one thing to put in to everything, and the pages are structured
to be expandable, but it takes a long time to prepare things to be put into a site. I think I put enough in to show the general structure of the website, which is the 
point of the project, but it would be a better portfolio site if it included more than just a small portion of my portfolio.</p>
<p> I actually have an entire Japanese site that I just hid the links to, I would have liked to be able to finish that in time, but it wasn't to be. </p>
<p> Also, I would have liked to spend more time tweaking some of the vector graphics, they aren't all quite perfect and they could be more cohesive. Some of my
CSS is really unclean, and I plan to spend some time consolidating and tidying it up when I get the chance. It just is unlikely to happen before the end of this project. </p>
