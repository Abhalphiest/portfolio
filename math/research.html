<h2> Lie Symmetries and Differential Equations </h2>
<p> Research into the theoretical foundations of symmetry methods for differential equations, including Lie Symmetry Groups of ODEs, PDEs, and systems, infinitesimal generators and their prolongations, and discrete symmetries.
Also investigated more advanced symmetry methods, such as variational symmetries, general (non-geometric) symmetries, and conservation laws. Currently investigating the application of these methods to various physical problems
arising from the physical sciences.</p>
