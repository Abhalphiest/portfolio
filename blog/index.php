	<p> 
	It seems like I can’t go more than a week without being reminded of the importance of specializing in the game industry - after all, at anything other than a very small company,
	there will be no need for you to do anything other than what you are best at, and you probably won’t even be the only person doing that. That kind of leads to a few fundamental conflicts in my life -
	<span id="brave"> </span>
	If the whole appeal of a degree in Game Design over, say, Computer Science for me is in being able to learn all of the non-engine development aspects of making a game, from assets to design to interfaces to world building,
	then how does that match up with the need for specialization? And given how wide and erratic my interests tend to be, and how broad my education thus far, what does that mean for me? Am I just an engine programmer who
	hasn’t been able to dedicate enough time to engines to be competitive? Or does the fact that I also know the math, also know design, also know art and music and narrative and hardware and the list goes on actually count for something?</p>
	<p>
	And if it does count for something, what? And why?
	What is a renaissance man in the context of games? And separate from that, in the context of the game industry? 
	I don’t really have any answers, but I’m hoping that as I ingratiate myself within the industry I find some. Maybe I’ll be back with an update then.

		<h1>The Importance of Being Brave</h1> <!-- title -->
		<h3> how I learned to stop worrying and love the fear </h3> <!-- sub title -->
		<time>2015-11-05</time> <!-- date -->
	</div>
	<p> 
		Due to what I could only call a non-standard childhood, I managed to reach college with nearly none of the experiences that the people around me have. I’ve dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to bridging that gap, and here are some of the things I’ve learned along the way.

		<h2>If you’re afraid of something, you should probably do it.</h2>
			<p>Of course, this requires some context. Being afraid of throwing yourself out of a moving car into a pit of snakes is a perfectly reasonable fear, 
			and facing that fear is at best inadvisable. But most of us aren’t in that situation when we’re afraid. There have been plenty of new experiences where all 
			I could do is hold my breath and just do it. This seems to come up most often in social situations - I can’t tell you how many times I’ve forced myself to
			start a conversation, and just hoped that my hands weren’t shaking visibly - but it’s applicable everywhere. I rode a bike for the first time this past summer,
			and I think that all applications of this general rule end up being analogous to the moment when I had to take my foot off the ground and put it on the pedal for that first push forward. 
			The hardest part is in the starting, not the doing.

			<h2>Being flexible is of the utmost importance. </h2>
				<p>This one, I’ll be honest, started with food. If you can imagine having had a lifelong diet of things available at a 7-11, you have a pretty good idea of the kind of food I was raised on.
				Of course, I had tried some things past that, but I was a hopelessly picky eater, simply because I was used to an incredibly limited range of foods. 
				Everything else seemed to belong to this immutable group of “not-food”, things that I logically recognized as edible but had no interest in whatsoever. </p>
				<p>Part of my great quest for common experiences was cooking my own meals - I didn’t know how to cook, really, but I figured it out.
				With that came grocery shopping… and with grocery shopping came a great source of new things to try - I had been aiming for one new experience a day, 
				and there was enough food I had never tried to fill a book. It was a match made in heaven. As I tried more things (vegetables, fish, different types of cheeses, yogurt, etc), the more I 
				realized I actually liked them. And when I was no longer on the campus meal plan (required for freshmen), my diet became inexplicably almost all vegetable. Who knew, right? </p>
				<p>Coming roundabout to the point here, I know now that I won’t ever have to refuse food, because I’m no longer picky. Socially, professionally, even just psychologically, 
				being able to say yes more often than not is key. It doesn’t matter if I like something the first time I try it - black coffee took months of forcing myself to down a cup before
				I got used to it - the idea is that once I can tolerate something, it becomes an asset. Now, if someone asks me if I want a coffee, I can say “Yes, I would love one!” 
				and not something negative. That flexibility is of non-negligible benefit. </p>

			<h2>People love to talk about things they know</h2>
				<p>This one seems like a really obvious fact, but it didn’t really sink in until I started to catch up culturally. 
				Being able to talk to other people about their interests enthusiastically, having that shared base of experiences, builds connections between people so much more quickly than any other kind of conversation.
				Honestly, the effort to immerse myself in new experiences has been paid back a hundredfold in how much easier it is to network, which I was not expecting. </p>
			
			<h2>Strive to be less comfortable</h2>
			<span id="waterhose"> </span>
				<p>Doing new things all the time forces you into a state of perpetual vulnerability - it’s unavoidable. This sounds unpleasant, but I’m finding it’s actually better than the alternative.
				There seems to be some kind of adventurousness law of inertia in play, where if I’m good and comfortable, the idea of being vulnerable and possibly looking like an idiot seems like a huge problem, 
				and if I’m suitably beaten down by constantly feeling uncomfortable and unsure, then suddenly the prospect of possibly doing something interesting outweighs the intimidation of being possibly unprepared. </p>
			
			<p> And really, those are the biggest results. I don't think I'll run out of new things any time soon, so I might be approaching things this way for a while to come. Hopefully that's a good thing.</p> <!-- content -->

		<h1>Drinking From the Water Hose</h1> <!-- title -->
		<h3> a beginner's guide to constructive self-loathing </h3> <!-- sub title -->
		<time>2015-10-31</time> <!-- date -->
	</div>
	<!-- content -->
	<p>There comes a time in just about everyone’s life when they become aware of two things near simultaneously: there’s something they want to learn, and they have no earthly idea where to start learning it.
	This happens to me seemingly near-constantly, and as I learn more and more, the things I’m drawn to only get harder and harder get a foothold in. </p>
	<p>
	For these situations, and lately for all my learning endeavors, I tend to just leap right in. I consume every resource I can lay my grubby hands on, whether I understand it or not, and just do. 
	Somehow, after a good long time being thoroughly lost, things start to almost make sense. You start recognizing words, start piecing things together, start having your uninformed guesses actually work the first time.
	This is a phenomenon that one of my closest friends refers to as “drinking from the water hose” - the act of actively drowning yourself in information until you manage to stay afloat. </p>
	<p>The single biggest drawback of this approach is how incredibly demoralizing it can be. The entire idea is to be completely and willfully incompetent at something you care deeply about for what feels like an eternity,
	and frustration is inevitable when you spend all your time in over your head. It’s important to remember to be fair to yourself. </p>
	<p>With all that being said, here’s my guide to hating your own ignorance (constructively!). </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Find somewhere to start. It doesn’t have to be reasonable, it doesn’t have to be something you can even finish, but it does have to be something where you can start it right now, 
		and you have some way of making what at least mechanically feels like progress. For academic things, I usually download a few papers, or take a textbook out of the library and start reading. 
		Doesn’t matter if I only understand every 3rd word, I need to process every single sentence in there. For more physical things, I try to get together the minimum necessary to do SOMETHING.
		For example, when trying to learn piano, I already knew how to read music so I printed some sheet music, figured out what keys went with which notes, and just played that music really, really badly. Actually doing the thing is key.</li>
		<li>Embrace the suck. You will feel really, really stupid. You will feel embarrassed. It will feel pointless to spend time on this, because you aren’t accomplishing a damn thing.
		You won’t have the nice positive feedback loop of an easier learning environment, or at least you won’t for a while. You just have to trust that your brain is working on it, and you only need to be persistent. </li>
		<li>Ride the high of noticeable improvement. Maybe you manage to read an entire chapter of your textbook without needing to emergency google. Maybe you played an entire song, and it didn’t make your ears bleed at all 
		(even if it wasn’t exactly correct). Maybe you watched a movie in the language you’re trying to learn, and you almost understood a few minutes of it. Fantastic! You’re winning! 
		Back to work, until you no longer feel like you’re trying to climb Mount Everest with dental floss and dreams. At that point, you’re done. </li>
		<li>Enjoy the brief feeling of accomplishment before you manage to find another brick wall to throw yourself headfirst into. In all honesty, this is the point where you try to formalize your knowledge.
		Go back to the higher level resources that you might actually understand this time through, and refine until you actually understand. For things that require a high degree of precision and education, try to find a way towards that,
		now that you know you can do it. It’s easier to fix bad habits or fill in holes in knowledge than it is to build something from nothing. The hard part is over, and you survived. </li>

		<h1> Markov Chains and the Value of Rigor</h1> <!-- title -->
		<h3>or rather, non-mathematicians doing some pretty cool math</h3> <!-- sub title -->
		<time datetime="2015-10-25"> 2015-10-25</time> <!-- date -->
	</div>
	<!-- content -->
		<p>I think I might be kind of a snob about math at this point. Some part of me is tempted to qualify that somehow, to point out that it’s really important to me and that there are a lot of 
		ways about how it’s handled in my various departments that really get to me. Maybe I want to explain that it’s something I’ve put a considerable amount of blood, sweat, and tears into, and 
		I feel proud that I have something to set me apart from a good portion of humanity. I know (some, never enough) advanced math, I can drop that little trait of mine for some instant intimidation
		points at most parties, and I get to feel smugly superior to everyone else in the Game Design major, knowing that all the math they have is the two survey courses they need at bare minimum to
		understand graphics programming, a non-rigorous discrete math, and algebra based physics. 
		</p>
		<p>But at the end of the day, even reading over that last paragraph, I can tell I’m pretty much just a jerk. My personality flaws, however, are going to be saved for another day, because this
		post has a point to it, and here it goes: about a week or so ago, I overheard one of my friends talking excitedly about Markov Chains for AI programming. This wouldn’t normally be anything spectacular 
		(after all, Markov Chains are excellent for all things related to finite state machines and probability), except for the fact that it was a second year Game Design student having the conversation.
		While I was listening to (and definitely not eavesdropping on) him explain how much time he’s spent on Wikipedia learning about them, I couldn’t help but remember how I learned about them - in a rigorous
		second course in Linear Algebra. A course that he would likely never take, and would likely need two semesters just to catch up on the prerequisites for. 
		</p>
		<p>And now I find myself, more and more often, questioning my snobbery. Not because the rigorous courses are somehow not worth it - they most certainly are - but because maybe, just maybe,
		more than half of the appeal of this major, these peers, this industry, is that when we want something done, we just… do it. My friend doesn’t understand the relationships between Markov Chains, 
		abstract linear transformations, eigenvalues, and invariability. Turns out, to do what he wants to do with them, he doesn’t need to. I used to think that having such minimal math requirements in
		the degree program was robbing people of an opportunity to use all of the great things that math has to offer, and now I’m starting to see that people will find a way to understand what they need 
		whether it was in a curriculum or not, which is pretty darn cool, and a little inspiring. I like to torture myself with the knowledge that I can’t actually take every class offered at RIT (because
		boy, would I like to), but maybe it’s the thirst for that knowledge that matters more than the environment, sometimes.
		</p>
		<p> I think I’ll keep this in mind, going forward.</p>
