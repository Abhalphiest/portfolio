	<p>There comes a time in just about everyone’s life when they become aware of two things near simultaneously: there’s something they want to learn, and they have no earthly idea where to start learning it.
	This happens to me seemingly near-constantly, and as I learn more and more, the things I’m drawn to only get harder and harder get a foothold in. </p>
	<p>
	For these situations, and lately for all my learning endeavors, I tend to just leap right in. I consume every resource I can lay my grubby hands on, whether I understand it or not, and just do. 
	Somehow, after a good long time being thoroughly lost, things start to almost make sense. You start recognizing words, start piecing things together, start having your uninformed guesses actually work the first time.
	This is a phenomenon that one of my closest friends refers to as “drinking from the water hose” - the act of actively drowning yourself in information until you manage to stay afloat. </p>
	<p>The single biggest drawback of this approach is how incredibly demoralizing it can be. The entire idea is to be completely and willfully incompetent at something you care deeply about for what feels like an eternity,
	and frustration is inevitable when you spend all your time in over your head. It’s important to remember to be fair to yourself. </p>
	<p>With all that being said, here’s my guide to hating your own ignorance (constructively!). </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Find somewhere to start. It doesn’t have to be reasonable, it doesn’t have to be something you can even finish, but it does have to be something where you can start it right now, 
		and you have some way of making what at least mechanically feels like progress. For academic things, I usually download a few papers, or take a textbook out of the library and start reading. 
		Doesn’t matter if I only understand every 3rd word, I need to process every single sentence in there. For more physical things, I try to get together the minimum necessary to do SOMETHING.
		For example, when trying to learn piano, I already knew how to read music so I printed some sheet music, figured out what keys went with which notes, and just played that music really, really badly. Actually doing the thing is key.</li>
		<li>Embrace the suck. You will feel really, really stupid. You will feel embarrassed. It will feel pointless to spend time on this, because you aren’t accomplishing a damn thing.
		You won’t have the nice positive feedback loop of an easier learning environment, or at least you won’t for a while. You just have to trust that your brain is working on it, and you only need to be persistent. </li>
		<li>Ride the high of noticeable improvement. Maybe you manage to read an entire chapter of your textbook without needing to emergency google. Maybe you played an entire song, and it didn’t make your ears bleed at all 
		(even if it wasn’t exactly correct). Maybe you watched a movie in the language you’re trying to learn, and you almost understood a few minutes of it. Fantastic! You’re winning! 
		Back to work, until you no longer feel like you’re trying to climb Mount Everest with dental floss and dreams. At that point, you’re done. </li>
		<li>Enjoy the brief feeling of accomplishment before you manage to find another brick wall to throw yourself headfirst into. In all honesty, this is the point where you try to formalize your knowledge.
		Go back to the higher level resources that you might actually understand this time through, and refine until you actually understand. For things that require a high degree of precision and education, try to find a way towards that,
		now that you know you can do it. It’s easier to fix bad habits or fill in holes in knowledge than it is to build something from nothing. The hard part is over, and you survived. </li>
