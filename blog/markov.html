		<p>I think I might be kind of a snob about math at this point. Some part of me is tempted to qualify that somehow, to point out that it’s really important to me and that there are a lot of 
		ways about how it’s handled in my various departments that really get to me. Maybe I want to explain that it’s something I’ve put a considerable amount of blood, sweat, and tears into, and 
		I feel proud that I have something to set me apart from a good portion of humanity. I know (some, never enough) advanced math, I can drop that little trait of mine for some instant intimidation
		points at most parties, and I get to feel smugly superior to everyone else in the Game Design major, knowing that all the math they have is the two survey courses they need at bare minimum to
		understand graphics programming, a non-rigorous discrete math, and algebra based physics. 
		</p>
		<p>But at the end of the day, even reading over that last paragraph, I can tell I’m pretty much just a jerk. My personality flaws, however, are going to be saved for another day, because this
		post has a point to it, and here it goes: about a week or so ago, I overheard one of my friends talking excitedly about Markov Chains for AI programming. This wouldn’t normally be anything spectacular 
		(after all, Markov Chains are excellent for all things related to finite state machines and probability), except for the fact that it was a second year Game Design student having the conversation.
		While I was listening to (and definitely not eavesdropping on) him explain how much time he’s spent on Wikipedia learning about them, I couldn’t help but remember how I learned about them - in a rigorous
		second course in Linear Algebra. A course that he would likely never take, and would likely need two semesters just to catch up on the prerequisites for. 
		</p>
		<p>And now I find myself, more and more often, questioning my snobbery. Not because the rigorous courses are somehow not worth it - they most certainly are - but because maybe, just maybe,
		more than half of the appeal of this major, these peers, this industry, is that when we want something done, we just… do it. My friend doesn’t understand the relationships between Markov Chains, 
		abstract linear transformations, eigenvalues, and invariability. Turns out, to do what he wants to do with them, he doesn’t need to. I used to think that having such minimal math requirements in
		the degree program was robbing people of an opportunity to use all of the great things that math has to offer, and now I’m starting to see that people will find a way to understand what they need 
		whether it was in a curriculum or not, which is pretty darn cool, and a little inspiring. I like to torture myself with the knowledge that I can’t actually take every class offered at RIT (because
		boy, would I like to), but maybe it’s the thirst for that knowledge that matters more than the environment, sometimes.
		</p>
		<p> I think I’ll keep this in mind, going forward.</p>
