	It seems like I can’t go more than a week without being reminded of the importance of specializing in the game industry - after all, at anything other than a very small company,
	there will be no need for you to do anything other than what you are best at, and you probably won’t even be the only person doing that. That kind of leads to a few fundamental conflicts in my life -
	<span id="brave"> </span>
	If the whole appeal of a degree in Game Design over, say, Computer Science for me is in being able to learn all of the non-engine development aspects of making a game, from assets to design to interfaces to world building,
	then how does that match up with the need for specialization? And given how wide and erratic my interests tend to be, and how broad my education thus far, what does that mean for me? Am I just an engine programmer who
	hasn’t been able to dedicate enough time to engines to be competitive? Or does the fact that I also know the math, also know design, also know art and music and narrative and hardware and the list goes on actually count for something?</p>
	<p>
	And if it does count for something, what? And why?
	What is a renaissance man in the context of games? And separate from that, in the context of the game industry? 
	I don’t really have any answers, but I’m hoping that as I ingratiate myself within the industry I find some. Maybe I’ll be back with an update then.
