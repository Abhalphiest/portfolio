		Due to what I could only call a non-standard childhood, I managed to reach college with nearly none of the experiences that the people around me have. I’ve dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to bridging that gap, and here are some of the things I’ve learned along the way.

		<h2>If you’re afraid of something, you should probably do it.</h2>
			<p>Of course, this requires some context. Being afraid of throwing yourself out of a moving car into a pit of snakes is a perfectly reasonable fear, 
			and facing that fear is at best inadvisable. But most of us aren’t in that situation when we’re afraid. There have been plenty of new experiences where all 
			I could do is hold my breath and just do it. This seems to come up most often in social situations - I can’t tell you how many times I’ve forced myself to
			start a conversation, and just hoped that my hands weren’t shaking visibly - but it’s applicable everywhere. I rode a bike for the first time this past summer,
			and I think that all applications of this general rule end up being analogous to the moment when I had to take my foot off the ground and put it on the pedal for that first push forward. 
			The hardest part is in the starting, not the doing.

			<h2>Being flexible is of the utmost importance. </h2>
				<p>This one, I’ll be honest, started with food. If you can imagine having had a lifelong diet of things available at a 7-11, you have a pretty good idea of the kind of food I was raised on.
				Of course, I had tried some things past that, but I was a hopelessly picky eater, simply because I was used to an incredibly limited range of foods. 
				Everything else seemed to belong to this immutable group of “not-food”, things that I logically recognized as edible but had no interest in whatsoever. </p>
				<p>Part of my great quest for common experiences was cooking my own meals - I didn’t know how to cook, really, but I figured it out.
				With that came grocery shopping… and with grocery shopping came a great source of new things to try - I had been aiming for one new experience a day, 
				and there was enough food I had never tried to fill a book. It was a match made in heaven. As I tried more things (vegetables, fish, different types of cheeses, yogurt, etc), the more I 
				realized I actually liked them. And when I was no longer on the campus meal plan (required for freshmen), my diet became inexplicably almost all vegetable. Who knew, right? </p>
				<p>Coming roundabout to the point here, I know now that I won’t ever have to refuse food, because I’m no longer picky. Socially, professionally, even just psychologically, 
				being able to say yes more often than not is key. It doesn’t matter if I like something the first time I try it - black coffee took months of forcing myself to down a cup before
				I got used to it - the idea is that once I can tolerate something, it becomes an asset. Now, if someone asks me if I want a coffee, I can say “Yes, I would love one!” 
				and not something negative. That flexibility is of non-negligible benefit. </p>

			<h2>People love to talk about things they know</h2>
				<p>This one seems like a really obvious fact, but it didn’t really sink in until I started to catch up culturally. 
				Being able to talk to other people about their interests enthusiastically, having that shared base of experiences, builds connections between people so much more quickly than any other kind of conversation.
				Honestly, the effort to immerse myself in new experiences has been paid back a hundredfold in how much easier it is to network, which I was not expecting. </p>
			
			<h2>Strive to be less comfortable</h2>
			<span id="waterhose"> </span>
				<p>Doing new things all the time forces you into a state of perpetual vulnerability - it’s unavoidable. This sounds unpleasant, but I’m finding it’s actually better than the alternative.
				There seems to be some kind of adventurousness law of inertia in play, where if I’m good and comfortable, the idea of being vulnerable and possibly looking like an idiot seems like a huge problem, 
				and if I’m suitably beaten down by constantly feeling uncomfortable and unsure, then suddenly the prospect of possibly doing something interesting outweighs the intimidation of being possibly unprepared. </p>
			
			<p> And really, those are the biggest results. I don't think I'll run out of new things any time soon, so I might be approaching things this way for a while to come. Hopefully that's a good thing.</p> <!-- content -->
